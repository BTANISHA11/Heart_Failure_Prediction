# Heart Failure Prediction Using Machine Learning
#### Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

#### Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

#### People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.
### Short Introduction
About 400,000 adults die of heart failure (HF) in the United States every year. HF occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to support the organs in the body [CDC]. Cardiovascular research studies have identified correlations between creatine levels, ejection fraction rates, and HF. Using machine learning classifiers, a patient's survival can be predicted based on important clinical features.
